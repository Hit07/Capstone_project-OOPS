# Turtle_Crossing_Capstone_Project
This is a classic arcade-style game where the player must safely guide a character across a busy street without being hit by any cars. The game is played on a screen, where the player moves their character one move at a time, while cars move in a linear fashion across the screen. The goal is to make it to the other side of the screen without being hit by any cars, and with each level, the traffic becomes more challenging.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. The game should start automatically.


## Gameplay

The player starts on one side of the screen, and the objective is to move their character to the other side of the screen. The player can move their character up, but they must avoid the moving traffic. The traffic moves in a linear fashion across the screen and the player must time their movements to avoid getting hit by any of the cars.

The game is played in levels, and each level introduces new challenges. For example, the traffic may become faster, or the player may need to navigate through gaps between cars. The player has a limited number of lives.

Controls

Up arrow key: move the character up
